# discordjs-v14-boilerplate

- Create a bot on https://discord.com/developers/applications with `Presence Intent`, `Server Members Intent`, `Message Content Intent`  
(scopes yet to be determined so give it the "Admin" scope for the time being)

- Get your Guild ID by right-clicking on your discord server (Make sure you have developer's mode enabled in `Settings > App Settings > Advanced`)

- Rename `.env_sample` to `.env` and edit it with information from the step above.

- Use `npm i` to install the required node modules.

- Launch bot with `node .` in root projet folder.
